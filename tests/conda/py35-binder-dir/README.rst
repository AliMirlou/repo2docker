Python 3.5, and a dedicated binder folder
-----------------------------------------

Test setup of Python 3.5 and the use of a dedicated binder folder that should
make files in the root directory be ignored.

The reasons for testing 3.5 specifically is that it is the oldest version of
Python 3 supported by repo2docker's conda buildpack. See
``repo2docker/buildpacks/conda`` for details.
